Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building a Regression Model to extract insights and predict outcomes from the given dataset. The primary objectives 
of the analysis are to understand the relationships between variables, identify patterns, and evaluate the performance of a predictive regression model.

Project Goals
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   * Summarize key statistical properties of the data.
   * Visualize trends, distributions, and relationships between variables.
   * Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
2. Regression Analysis:
   * Build a baseline regression model to predict the target variable.
   * Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics.
   * Optimize the model through feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

Dataset Description
* Dataset Name: (Replace with actual dataset name)
* Number of Rows and Columns: (Fill in after loading the data)
* Target Variable: (Specify the target variable for prediction)
* Independent Variables: Include numerical, categorical, or derived features used as predictors.
Data Preprocessing Steps
* Handled missing values through imputation techniques.
* Normalized numerical features using StandardScaler (if applicable).
* One-hot encoded categorical variables to incorporate them into the model.

Key Insights from EDA
* Descriptive statistics revealed (add key findings such as mean, median, variance).
* Correlation analysis showed significant relationships between (variable A) and (variable B).
* Visualization revealed (describe any key trends or outliers discovered).

Regression Model Details
1. Baseline Model:
   * Model Type: Linear Regression
   * Performance Metrics: R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
2. Model Optimization:
   * Feature selection using (e.g., PCA, backward elimination, etc.).
   * Hyperparameter tuning using (e.g., grid search, random search).

Evaluation Metrics
* R-squared: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
* MSE: Provides the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
* RMSE: Indicates how much the predictions deviate from actual values on average.

Results
* Best Model: (e.g., optimized regression model or baseline if it performed best)
* Key Predictors: (List variables contributing most to the predictions)
* Performance Metrics: Summarize the final evaluation metrics.

Future Improvements
* Incorporate additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
* Explore non-linear models if regression results are suboptimal.
* Address multicollinearity or heteroscedasticity in the dataset.
